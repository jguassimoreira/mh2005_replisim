# mh2005_replisim

Replication and extension of Maas & Hox's (2005) seminal paper on sample sizes for multilevel modeling.

'scripts' contains code used to run the replication simulation.

'funcs' contains customer helper functions to enhance efficiency of the replication simulation.

'data' contains the outcome of each condition of our replication sim. 

'results' houses a spreadsheet comparing the results of our sim to the original. 

The 'litsearch' spreadsheet contains the results of a literature review of 50 recently published empirical papers citing the original Maas & Hox simulation study. We examined why they were citing the original study and the multilevel modeling specifications used in their own study.  

'SuppTable1.xlsx' is a copy of Supplementary Table 1; 'm&h_litreview_journals.xlsx' is the full list of journals from the search/review with number of articles and publication years.
